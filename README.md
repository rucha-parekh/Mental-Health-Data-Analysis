# Mental-Health-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of mental health trends based on survey responses. It examines factors such as time spent indoors, occupational roles, and regional happiness scores to understand their relationship with growing stress. Users can explore the data interactively through filters for stress levels, countries, and response counts, gaining insights into how lifestyle and demographics influence mental well-being. Built with Tableau, it offers a clear and interactive way to visualize the data.
